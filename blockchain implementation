This is the blockchain part of our solution.
We built a smart contract called TouristID that gives every tourist a secure digital identity.

The contract stores four things: the tourist’s name, a hashed ID, their country, and the visit end date — all linked to their unique blockchain wallet address.

Tourists register using the issueID function, and their details are stored permanently on blockchain. Later, using getMyTouristID, the tourist or authorities can instantly verify the identity.

This prevents fake IDs, ensures tamper-proof records, and even if physical documents are lost, the tourist’s verified digital ID is always safe and accessible.
